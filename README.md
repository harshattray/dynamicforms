## DynamicForms

## Basic Overview

Built on react, redux with redux forms integration, these forms take in data from api (MockyApi in this case) and generates forms based on how the user interacts with them and the cumulative form data is submitted via a POST request (reqres in this case)

Complete Webpack integration with babel loaders processing custom css and js modules and transpiling them.

Redux dev tools are still enabled in this, mapped to the store so that dispached actions can be tracked (install redux dev tools plugin [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en))
